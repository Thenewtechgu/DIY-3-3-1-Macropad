1.1	Basic macropad schematics design
Time: 30 minutes
1.1.1 Summary:
Creating the basic schematics
1.1.2 Schematic Design Overview:
A 10 switch macro pad that has 1 switch for layer switching. The LED for showing the user what layer they are on

Challenges:
 Didn’t know how to route wires to the back of the board.
Forgot to add the 10th switch.
Solution:
After dugging through AI and Google I found out that you have to press the spacebar ( silly me).
Added the 10th switch

1.3	Added the components 3d files for board render
Time: 40 minutes
Since I didn’t know how to add the 3dfile to the library, I had to add each 3d file one at a time. 
1.4	3d Render the board for export and design the case
Time 1hour
I first designed the board with an open case concept so it was quick

I don’t have any photos 
Total time for day 1: 3 hours and 10 minutes




2.	25 July 24, 2025
2.1: Redesigning the outline of the board cause I realized that the board was  6 mm to long. 
Time: 20 minutes
2.2: Adding 2 more LED cause why not. And routed the 2 new  LED
Time: 20 minutes
2.3 Redesigning the case 
Time 1 hour
I had to redesign the case cause I had change the size of the board
At first I wanted the macropad to be at an angle but the decided otherwise

Then I designed the lid and some pegs to hold it in place

2.4 Reuploading the files to Github 
All done ( Ihope)
